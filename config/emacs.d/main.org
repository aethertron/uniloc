- [2016-11-13 Sun 13:43] Realized .emacs.d specific things should go here!

- Branch concepts

  + Copied from uniloc/main.org since it especially applies in this package!

  + Let's make sure commits main branch work on Blue and Kafkanet!

  + Working on carve is not a requirement

  + Would like to build towards always working on carve!

  + Carve will merge

  + Thus it's totally cool to configure things that won't work on carve yet!

  + Far future: a lean .emacs.d that will work even when there are no available packages!
